  <h2 className="content">How is codeX different to other programming courses?</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Mentors, not teachers.</strong> We’re here to guide you on your learning journey. Technology advances quickly, so codeX prepares you for a path of lifelong learning. We give you the tools to learn any coding language you may need to solve a problem, rather than focusing on one technology that could go out of date in a few years.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Self-paced program</strong> gives you the freedom to move quickly when you grasp a concept and to take time with more complex concepts. Along with mentors, codeX provides access to premium online coding tutorials to deepen your knowledge in targeted areas.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Agile thinking.</strong> Software is not just about what you build, it’s about how you build it. We give you the tools to manage your work - and your thoughts - the way much of the software industry does.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>We help you find a job.</strong> Our team helps with your CV, LinkedIn profile, interview skills, and arranges interviews with employers looking for new talent. Your success is our success, so we do everything we can to make sure you’re supported as you begin your tech career.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Collaboration, not competition.</strong> Our culture is about supporting each other to learn and succeed, not winning at all costs. Software development is a team sport.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Industry access.</strong>  codeX is based in Harrington Street at the heart of Cape Town’s trendy East City Precinct. Our collaboration with industry speakers, mentors and user groups means you can build networks and learn through events, meetups, and hackathons.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Personal development.</strong> codeX is an intense, fast-moving journey. We help you work through the challenges that arise during the program and provide you with the tools for success in the working world.</li>
</ul>
